## Retrospective (sprint 2)

A retrospective was held at the end of sprint 2. All team members were present. 


### Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel

Process: 

1. Draw a circle divided into 5 sections with the words "start", "stop", "continue", "more of" and "less of" written in the sections
2. Ask: What should we start doing? What should we stop doing (is not contributing or is getting in our way)? What do we want to continue doing (is working)? What should we do more of? Less of?
3. Encourage comments in the categories and write them down in the appropriate sections


### Development measures

Development measures where the team will aspire to do better in the next sprint

- Stop: Moving on to code a new thing/feature if tests fail.
- Continue: Continue focusing on things that bring the customer most value. 
- More of: Communicating more on who will take on previously unallocated tasks (like hotfixes), so that there is no overlapping work done by team members.
- Less of: Dividing tasks last-minute, so that the division is more clear and risk of confusion is diminished. 


### Impact

Since the last retrospective the team managed to make successful improvements based on the decided development measures. 

* Whenever tests failed, focus shifted to fixing the issue and there were less CI failures than during the previous sprint. 
* Overall focus stayed well on user stories and the work did not digress. This was well continued. 
* Communication improved and team members were more active on Discord during the busiest working days, which helped avoid conflicts.
* Some last-minute allocation of tasks remained, but overall the level was reasonable. The main tasks were divided at the start of the sprint.
