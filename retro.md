## Retrospective (sprint 2)

A retrospective will be held at the end of sprint 2. 


### Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel

Process: 

1. Draw a circle divided into 5 sections with the words "start", "stop", "continue", "more of" and "less of" written in the sections
2. Ask: What should we start doing? What should we stop doing (is not contributing or is getting in our way)? What do we want to continue doing (is working)? What should we do more of? Less of?
3. Encourage comments in the categories and write them down in the appropriate section


### Development measures

Development measures where the team will aspire to do better in the next sprint

- Stop: Moving on to code a new thing/feature if tests fail.
- Continue: Continue focusing on things that bring the cutomer most value. 
- More of: Communicating more on who will take on previously unallocated tasks (like hotfixes), so that there is no overlapping work done by team members.
- Less of: Dividing tasks last-minute, so that the division is more clear and risk of confusion is diminished.
